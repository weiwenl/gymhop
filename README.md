Problem statement: Climbers in Singapore often lose track on the number of gym passes they own and the expiry dates of each set of gym passes.

Solution: This application will allow you to view the total number of passes you own, show the expiry dates of each set of multi-pass from different gyms and alert you when a set of multi-pass is about to expire.

As you check in into the climbing gym in the app, the app will deduct pass(es) from the database and show the remaining count.
